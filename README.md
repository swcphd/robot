In this repo you will find a python script called `camera_test.py`. Running this script should show a live feed from the pi's camera

You will also find files called `shutdown.py` and `shutdown.service`. In the greyboxes repo you will find instructions on how to make a fancy restart button for your pi, a very handy tool. This tutorial will also give you a clue as to how you can instruct your pi to run a script upon booting up.
